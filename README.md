# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

#### The R portfolio is located [here](https://rpubs.com/wbgreen405).

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._
